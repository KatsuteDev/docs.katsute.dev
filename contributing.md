# Contributing

## Use the 'make a contribution button'

![Make a contribution](/dependencies/katsute/assets/screenshots/contributing.png)

To simplify making changes for new devs, at the bottom of each page there is a **make a contribution** button which will redirect you to the corrosponding page on our [repository](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev).

Make sure to check existing [issues](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/issues) before requesting a change.

## Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/issues) are used to track requests that contributors can help with. If an issue already has an assignee, you probably shouldn't work on it.

If there is a problem with one of the documentation pages, or if it needs updating you can also open a [new issue](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/issues/new/choose).

## Pull Requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/pulls) are changes that are pending approval by a maintainer. If a pull already exists for an issue, you probably shouldn't work on it.

Pulls should be accompanied by an existing [issue](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/issues).

## Translations

Translations are needed for [translations.yml](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/blob/main/_data/translations.yml) and documentation.

For the [`translations.yml`](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/docs.katsute.dev/blob/main/_data/translations.yml) file use the same keys as the English translation.

For page translation simply copy the file from the English `/en` folder to a different language folder at the same path. Ex: `/en/contributing.md` â†’ `/ja/contributing.md`.
